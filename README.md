# Carson Zuniga Personal Repo
This is where I publish my personal projects, displaying my journey as a programmer. <br>
Check out my Sudoku Solver (Official Releases) and Minesweeper (Unofficial Releases) applications for my most recent work. <br>
While you're at it, check out my collaborative project on airline pathfinding. You can find it under CarsonZuniga/Airport_Database_CS225_Final <br>
I am currently developing a website right now, revolving around random art generation / database scraping. Find it under ArtScraper (Unofficial Releases) <br>
Stay tuned. <br>
