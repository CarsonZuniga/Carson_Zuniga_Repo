# Carson Zuniga Personal Repo
This is where I publish my personal projects, displaying my journey as a programmer. <br>
Check out my Sudoku Solver (Official Releases) and Minesweeper (Unofficial Releases) applications for my most recent work. <br>
I hope to develop a website soon, revolving around random art generation / database scraping. Stay tuned. <br>
